Linda talks about the actions they will take during a meeting. Letâ€™s explore the key words:

`We need to go over the report before the presentation` - meaning that they need to review the report in detail.

`decide on` means to choose or make a decision about something. For example: 

`We need to decide on the final design by Friday` - meaning they need to choose the final design by that deadline.
