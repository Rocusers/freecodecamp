# --description--

When someone asks you a **yes/no question**, you can often respond with a short answer. 

This applies to questions in the Present Perfect tense as well. 

To give a short answer, use `Yes` or `No`, followed by the subject (like `I`, `we`, or `they`) and then `have` or `haven’t`. For example:

`Have you seen the report?`

Short answer: `Yes, I have.` or `No, I haven’t.`

This makes your answer clear and concise without repeating the whole question.

# --question--

## --text--

Linda has read the reports. How could she confirm that to James?

## --answers--

`Yes, I have.`

---

`Yes, I do.`

### --feedback--

This answer is incorrect because `do` is used in response to questions in the Present Simple tense, not the Present Perfect. Since James asked the question in the Present Perfect tense, the correct short answer should use present perfect.
