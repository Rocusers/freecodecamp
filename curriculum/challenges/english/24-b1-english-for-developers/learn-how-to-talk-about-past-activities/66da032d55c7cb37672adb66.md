# --explanation--

`Drop` refers to a decrease in amount or level. When we say there is `a drop in sales`, it means sales have gone down. 

When you add the word `significant` before `drop`, it means the decrease is large or important. For example, `a significant drop in sales` means that sales have decreased a lot.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which sentence is saying that sales had a big reduction?

## --answers--

`There has been a significant drop in sales this quarter.`

---

`There has been a significant increase in sales this quarter.`

### --feedback--

This sentence talks about an increase, not a decrease. `Increase` means the amount has gone up, not down.

---

`There has been a significant rise in sales this quarter.`

### --feedback--

`Rise` means an upward movement, indicating growth in sales, not a reduction.

---

`There has been a moderate drop in sales this quarter.`

### --feedback--

While this sentence mentions a `drop`, the word `moderate` means a small or not very large decrease, not a `significant` one.
