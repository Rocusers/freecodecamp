<!-- (Audio) James: Have you seen the latest user feedback? -->

# --description--

James is asking about the most recent comments or reports from users about their experience with a product or service. Let's review two important terms:

`Latest`means the most recent or newest. When James asks about the `latest user feedback`, he wants to know about the most up-to-date comments or reports.
  
`User feedback`refers to the opinions, comments, or issues that users share about a product, service, or experience. 

Understanding these terms will help you figure out what James is trying to find out.

# --question--

## --text--

What does James want to know?

---

He wants to know if Linda has seen the most recent user feedback.

He wants to know when the user feedback was collected.

### --feedback--
