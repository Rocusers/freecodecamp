# --explanation--

The word `already` is used in the present perfect tense to indicate that something has happened sooner than expected or before now. For example:

`They have already left the meeting.` (This shows the action happened before now.)

The word `started` is the past participle form of `start`, which means to begin an action.

In the sentence `We've already started working on the fixes,` `already` shows that they began working on the fixes sooner than expected.
