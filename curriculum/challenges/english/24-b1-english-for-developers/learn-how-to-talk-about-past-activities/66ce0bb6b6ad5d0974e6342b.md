<!-- (Audio) James: Has the development team been informed about this? -->

# --description--

To understand James's question, let's break down the structure in the Present Perfect tense:

`Has` is the auxiliary verb used to form the question. It helps to ask about an action that might have been completed up to now.

`Been` is used to indicate the passive voice, meaning the action (informing) has been done to the subject.

`informed` is the past participle of the verb `inform`, showing that the action of giving information might have already happened.

The subject in this question is `the development team`. 

Since James is asking, `Has the development team been informed?` he wants to know if the action of informing has been completed specifically for the development team.
