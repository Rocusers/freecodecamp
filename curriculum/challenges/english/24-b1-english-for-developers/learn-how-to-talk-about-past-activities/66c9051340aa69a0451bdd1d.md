<!-- (Audio) Linda: They've emailed us screenshots showing how the elements overlap on their devices. -->

# --description--

`overlap` is used when one thing covers or extends over part of another. In this context, it means that elements on the screen are incorrectly positioned, covering parts of each other.
`on` is used to indicate the device where the overlapping occurs. It shows the relationship between the elements and the devices. For example: 

`The images overlap on the webpage, making it difficult to see all the content clearly.` - `overlap` describes the positioning issue and how `on` specifies where it occurs.
