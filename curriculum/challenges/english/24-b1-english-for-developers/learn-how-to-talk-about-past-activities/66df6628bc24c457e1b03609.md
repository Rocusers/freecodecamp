AUDIO REFERENCE:
James: Have any users specifically mentioned these issues in their feedback?
-->

# --description--

When you ask if something was mentioned `specifically`, you want to know if it was mentioned directly, without any doubt or generalization. For example:

- `She asked specifically about the new project.` (She asked directly about the project, not in general.)
- `The report specifically mentions the changes we need to make.` (The report talks directly about the changes.)

In James's question, `Have any users specifically mentioned these issues in their feedback?`, he wants to know if the users have directly talked about the issues, not just mentioned them in general terms.
