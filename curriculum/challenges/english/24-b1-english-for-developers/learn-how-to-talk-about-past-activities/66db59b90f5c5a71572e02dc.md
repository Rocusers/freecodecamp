# --explanation--

The word `already` is used with the present perfect tense to indicate that something happened sooner than expected or before now. For example:

- `She has already finished her work.` (This shows the action was completed earlier than expected.)
- `They have already left for the meeting.` (This means they left sooner than expected.)
