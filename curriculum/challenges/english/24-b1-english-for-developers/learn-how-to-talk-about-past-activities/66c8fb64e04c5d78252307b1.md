James is asking Linda if she has been able to find out which elements are causing the trouble.

The phrase `have the time` is used to ask if someone had enough time or the opportunity to do something.

That is why James says, `have you had the time`, because he wants to know if Linda had the opportunity to identify the problem elements before this moment.
