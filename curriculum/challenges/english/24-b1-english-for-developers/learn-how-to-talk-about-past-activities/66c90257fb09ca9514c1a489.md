<!-- (Audio) James: Have we received any detailed reports from users about this issue? -->

# --description--

In this case, Linda needs to confirm whether she has already received the reports.

Consider the difference between these two responses:

`Yes, a few, actually.`: This answer confirms that Linda has **already** received some reports. 

`Yes, we will receive the reports soon.`: This answer suggests that the reports **have not yet** been received but are expected in the future. It doesn't confirm that any reports have already been received.

Understanding this difference will help you choose the correct answer.
