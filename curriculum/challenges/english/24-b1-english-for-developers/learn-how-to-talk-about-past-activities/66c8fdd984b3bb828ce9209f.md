# --description--

The Present Perfect Continuous tense is used to describe actions that started in the past and are still continuing or have recently stopped, often with an emphasis on the duration of the action. 

This tense is formed using `have/has been` + the present participle (verb ending in `-ing`).

In Linda's sentence:

`haven't been`: This indicates that something has not been happening continuously up to now.

`adapting`: This is the present participle of the verb `adapt`, indicating an ongoing action.

Linda is explaining that the navigation bar and the footer have not been working well on smaller screens over a period of time.
