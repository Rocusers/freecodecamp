# --explanation--

To form the present perfect tense, use `have` or `has` with the past participle of the main verb. 

When asking a question, start with `have` or `has`, then the subject (`you`, `he`, etc.), and the past participle.

For example: `Have you finished your project?` (`have` + subject + `finished`).
