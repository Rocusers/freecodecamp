# --explanation--

In the present perfect tense, `already` is used to show that something has happened sooner than expected or earlier than the present moment. It is placed between the auxiliary verb (`have` or `has`) and the past participle of the main verb. For example:

- `She has already finished her analysis.` (This means she finished her analysis earlier than expected.)
- `We have already seen that report.` (This shows the action happened before now.)

In the sentence, `The navigation bar and footer adjustments have already made a big difference,` `already` shows that the changes have had an impact sooner than expected.
