# --description--

`Since` is used with the present perfect tense to show when an action or event started in the past and continues to the present. 

For example: `I have worked here since 2019.` This means the action of working started in 2019 and is still true now.

Use `since` with a specific point in time (like a year, date, or a specific event).

# --question--

## --text--

Which of the following sentences uses `since` correctly with the present perfect tense?

## --answers--

`They have been friends since high school.`

---

`They have been friends since three years.`

### --feedback--

`Since` should be followed by a specific point in time (like `high school` or `a year`), not a duration.

---

`They were friends since high school.`

### --feedback--

This sentence is grammatically correct, but it uses the past simple (`were friends`), which suggests their friendship is no longer ongoing. To show that their friendship started in the past and continues to now, you would use the present perfect (`have been friends`) with `since`.

---

`They will be friends since high school.`

### --feedback--

`Since` is not used with future tense. It shows when a past action started that is still relevant now.
