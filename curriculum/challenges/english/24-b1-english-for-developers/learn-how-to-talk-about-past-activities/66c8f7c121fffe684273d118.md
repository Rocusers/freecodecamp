# --description--

When answering to a yes/no question in the Present Perfect tense, you can use short answers.

- For a positive answer, you would say `Yes, we have.` This confirms that the action has been done before.
- For a negative answer, you would say `No, we haven't.` This clearly indicates that the action has not been done before.
