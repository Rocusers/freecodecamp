<!-- (Audio) James: Have we fixed anything like this before? -->

# --description--

The Present Perfect Simple tense is often used to ask about experiences or actions that happened at an unspecified time in the past. When forming questions in this tense, the structure is:

- `Have` or `Has` (auxiliary verb) + subject + past participle (main verb).

For example:

- `Have you ever been to the HR?`

- `Has it finished loading the updated?`

James is using this structure to ask if a similar issue has been resolved in the past.
