AUDIO REFERENCE:
Linda: But we haven't addressed all the minor elements yet.
-->

# --explanation--

In the present perfect, `yet` is used in negative sentences or questions to talk about something that hasn't happened up to now but is expected to happen in the future. For example:

`I haven't finished my work yet.` (This means the work is not finished, but it is expected to be completed.)

`Has she called you yet?` (This is asking if the call has happened up to now.)

In the sentence, `We haven't addressed all the minor elements yet,` `yet` shows that addressing the minor elements is something expected to happen in the future, but it hasn't been done up to now.
