# --description--

The Present Perfect tense is used to talk about actions or experiences that happened at some point before now.

Use this structure to talk about something that happened before now, but **where the exact time isn’t important**.

To form the Present Perfect tense, use `have` or `has` followed by the past participle of the verb.

The past participle of the verb `see` is `seen`. It's irregular, which means it doesn’t just add `-ed` like regular verbs. 

For example:

- `I have seen the report.` (This means that at some point before now, I saw the report.)
- `She has seen the report.` (This means that at some point before now, she read the report.)

Remember that in the Present Perfect tense, you use `have` or `has` followed by the past participle of the verb. The past participle of `see` is irregular, and it is not `see` or `saw`.
