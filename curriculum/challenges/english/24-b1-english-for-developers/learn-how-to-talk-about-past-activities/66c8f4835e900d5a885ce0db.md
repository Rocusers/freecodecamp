<!-- (Audio) Linda: Yes, I've reviewed the reports. It seems we've got a UI display issue across different screen sizes. -->

# --description--

Linda identifies a problem after reviewing the reports. Let's break down the key vocabulary:

`UI display issue`: `UI` stands for User Interface. A `display issue` means that these `UI` elements are not appearing or functioning as they should.

`Across different screen sizes`: This phrase means that the problem is happening on devices with various screen dimensions, such as smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
